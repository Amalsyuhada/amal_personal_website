<br><p><font size="4">While waiting for my diploma results, I worked part time in several shops near my home for almost a year. Among the jobs I did was, working as a salesman in a clothing store which is I was assigned to arrange the clothes according to type and design. In addition I also need to attract customers to buy in our store. Meanwhile at flower shop, I was assigned to make and decorate bouquets and suprise parties for customers. There are various things that i can learn apart from honing communication and problem solving skills. Not only that, the results of the part time job I use to pay tuition fees. In addition, it can increase self -confidence from dealing with customers. So I took this experience as a challenge and an interesting memory for me.  </font></p></br>
