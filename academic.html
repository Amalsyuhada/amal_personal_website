<br><p><font size="4">I went to school at SMK Tengku Abdullah Pekan, Pahang since 2013 until 2017 and when I was in form 4 and 5 I took up the business stream. Therefore, I have a basic knowledge of business. After getting the SPM results, I then continued my studies to in 2019 until 2020 pre -diploma at UITM Jengka Pahang in the business course. In the pre -diploma, I was taught basic business and also accounts. Next, I was offered a diploma in information management course in Machang Kelantan. Although it is far from Pahang but I still accept it and make it a challenge for me to be away from my family. </font></p></br>

<br><p><font size="4"> As I studied this course, I gained many new skills, especially computer skills. when I was in semester 1, I had some difficulty in adapting to learning because Malaysia was shaken by an outbreak of COVID 19 virus.While in semester 2 and 3 I learned how to use software such as adobe premiere pro, adobe photoshop, adobe illustration and so on to edit images, create e-magazines and poster. Honestly, it was a bit challenging but I still felt fun and excited while completing the assignment. This is because, I am very weak if it is related to computers but with the help of lecturers and very supportive friends, I finally managed to complete the task given well even though I was only at home due to the COVID 19 pandemic.Moreover, while in semester 5 there also a lot of new experiences I gained. Among them is a visit to Kuala Lumpur for 4 days and 3 nights where we visited various information centers an i was also given the task to manage the extension of the program at Sk Pahi Kelantan with a friend and the help of a lecturer. In addition, I also participated in several talks organized under the faculty of information management.  </font></p></br>
